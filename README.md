# Seam_Carving

Project: Seam Carving
People: Lishuo Pan

Instruction:
Run all the required functions are complete.
Some functions contain the help functions which are embedded in the existed functions.

In order to run the whole program, run main_script.py
**The function will read the "source.jpg" file under the same path with main_script. Make sure "source.jpg" file is under the same path with main_script.
The output gif file will be named "output.gif"

All source .jpg files I used in at the top direction as backup named "source0.jpg" and "source1.jpg". And all gif generated by the program is also at the top level named "output0.gif" and "output1.gif". (Notice that the current test .jpg file is the same as "source0.jpg" and current test .gif file is the same as "output0.gif" file)

You can open output_gif to see the pre-created gif to preview the results.
